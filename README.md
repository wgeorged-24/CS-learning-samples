# CS-learning-samples
Sample interactive learning resources focused on first encounters with core computer science concepts.

# Interactive Learning Samples

This repository contains two interactive HTML learning resources designed to introduce abstract computer science concepts through structured, misconception-aware progression.

## Samples

### 1. Introduction to Algorithms
An introductory resource for learners encountering algorithms for the first time. The experience builds from familiar, concrete processes and incrementally abstracts them into structured steps, allowing the concept of an algorithm to emerge naturally through interaction.

### 2. Introducing the Binary Number System
A first encounter with binary that explicitly maps the structure of the denary number system to base-2 representation. The focus is on why place value exists and how base determines structure, rather than memorising procedures.

These resources are designed to be experienced directly. Interactivity is central to the learning design.
